# TOMCAT DEPLOYMENT

The goal of this exercise is to automate the deployment of tomcat with Ansible 
and test the deployment in a container.
 
 - Write an ansible tomcat_deploy.yml playbook to install a tomcat server with 
   the following parameters :
   - Tomcat version : 8
   - JVM Max heap size depending on environment :
   ~~~
   DEV: 256Mo
   PROD: 512Mo
   ~~~
 - Deploy "sample.war"
 - Write a short "tomcat_deploy.sh" (less than 10 lines) to test 
   ansible configuration in a docker container. This script should :
   - build the test container from the Dockerfile contained in /tomcat_deploy
   - launch the container and execute it from tomcat_test.sh (already present)
     to execute the playbook and launch a set of tests.
